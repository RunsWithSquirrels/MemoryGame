## Introduction

Hello! My name is Mallory Tompsett, and this is my Memory Game Project. I have made a completely interactive version of the Memory Game Project for you to play and enjoy. In the following "Instructions" and "Contributing" sections I have left the original messages from Udacity in place. Please have fun exploring and playing my project!

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game Project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

For details, check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
